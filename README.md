# Handwritten-Number-Generator
This program is based off GANs, specifically the DCGAN with my own addition of a condition which I will explain below. The fundamental idea is that two deep neural network models play a minimax game. The Generator tries to trick the Discriminator into classifying the Generated data as real while the Discriminator tries to classify fake data as fake and real data as real. Hence the 'Adversarial' in GAN. The DCGAN uses deep convolutional layers while omitting all feed-forward layers. This specific variant of DCGAN uses condition as well as weight clipping as a quick way of enforcing lipchitz constraint (although gradient penatly is more effective. Refer to my WGAN repo for more info).
